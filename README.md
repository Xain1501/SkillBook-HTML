# 📘 SkillBook – HTML-Only Version

This is the foundational version of the SkillBook app, built **entirely with HTML5** — no CSS, no JavaScript.

The purpose of this stage is to structure the entire UI using semantic HTML and build a clear layout without any styling or interactivity. This sets the groundwork for progressive enhancement in future stages.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Practice semantic HTML
- Structure UI elements with meaningful tags
- Build a multi-page layout using pure HTML
- Focus on accessibility and clean hierarchy

## 📄 Pages

| Page             | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| `index.html`     | Landing page with app overview     |
| `about.html`     | Info about the app/purpose         |
| `add-skill.html` | Form to input a new skill          |
| `skills.html`    | View a list of skills (static now) |
| `contact.html`   | Contact form (non-functional)      |
